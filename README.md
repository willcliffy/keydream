# Keydream

Playing around with Lua and LÖVE.

## Playing
At the moment, you must have LÖVE installed to play. Someday soon I'll be able to make executables.

Download the `keydream.love` file from Releases, navigate to the directory where it was downloaded and execute `love keydream.love`

## Development
- Build-from-source instructions coming soon.
